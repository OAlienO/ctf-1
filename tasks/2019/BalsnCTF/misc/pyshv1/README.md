# Overview, Concept and Design Criteria
Intially, I wanted to create some reverse challenge using pickle.
(Yep, one of that strange language series)

However, when I playing with pickle VM,
I realized that it's RIDICULOUSLY POWERFUL.

It shouldn't be limited to some noob `__reduce__` RCE.

Make pickle-pwn great again.


# Solution
Will be released 72 hours after the end of competition.
