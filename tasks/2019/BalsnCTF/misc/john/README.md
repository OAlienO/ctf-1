# Overview, Concept and Design Criteria
In fact, I just wanted to create some baby and fun challenge that leak something in packet size.

But when I implemented it,
it's NOT WORKING AT ALL.

The cute baby suddenly becomes a devel ðŸ‘¿ .

And it's the one of the hardest challenges that we thought no team will conquer.

## Design Criteria
I changed the oracle in this task several times,
and UTF-8 oracle seems to be the most interesting one.

Due to the fact that the packet leak is not pretty stable,
the flag is hex-encoded to increase the entropy we can got from each successful oracle.


# Solution
Will be released 72 hours after the end of competition.
